# Week-9-Assignment
codepath on honeypots

Time spent: 5 hours

Issues:

Had to use gcloud auth login to use a few commands in the VMs. Also had to use the github repo $ sudo git clone https://github.com/threatstream/mhn.git
instead of the one listed. 

Deployed one honeypot: Dionaea (honeypot-1)
Roughly 1380 attacks from all over the world over the span of 5 hours. No malware recieved.
